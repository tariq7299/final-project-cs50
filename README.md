## Some notes on branches
- First of all !, all of those branches is not fully working but rather it is some different versions of implementing some components and parts of the code   

### 'router-link' branch
*files to check **or** files that is relative*
- 'Home.vue'
- 'routes.js'
- 'AddExpense'
- 'routes.py'
- 'MonthTimeFrame'

*What this branch does*
In this branch I have used `<router-link>` that belongs to vue js, by passing some varialbes in the defined route, and on the other side of route I extracted those variables from URL and used them in the page code

*How to see the changes*
- Just visit 'Add Expenses' link at the bottom of page in Home view  
- Understand what is going on in "AddExpense.vue" and 'Home.vue' and 'routes.js'

### 'monthTimeFrameBranch' branch
*files to check **or** files that is relative*
- 'MonthTimeFrame'
- 'routes.py'

*What this branch does*
In this branch I used different ways to view years and months, by using different methods to fetch spendings data in "methods" found in 'MonthTimeFrame.vue', that is different than what I am using right now in main branch, that is the only distict thing   

*How to see the changes*
- Visit Home page, look at the years and months selecet inputs
- Understand what is going on in "MonthTimeFrame.vue' and axios requests that sent back and fourth to the flask server in 'routes.py'
- All the main changes can be found in 'methods:' in 'MonthTimeFrame'
### 'monthTimeFrameBranch' branch
*files to check **or** files that is relative*
- 'MonthTimeFrame'
- 'routes.py'

*What this branch does*
In this branch I used different ways to view years and months, by using different methods to fetch spendings data in "methods" found in 'MonthTimeFrame.vue', that is different than what I am using right now in main branch, that is the only distict thing   

*How to see the changes*

- All the main changes can be found in 'methods:' in 'MonthTimeFrame'  

## 'ChooseTimeFrame' branch 

*files to check **or** files that is relative*
- ChooseTimeFrame.veu

*What this branch does*
- I have written the years accordion in a different way, so I didn't use `v-show`, and `<TransitionGroup>`
- THere is a bug that I couldn't fix in that branch and that I occures when you try to click on/choose a month, and it actually works fine and preview the clkicked months's expenses, However, you have to diuble click it in order to apply styling and change its color.
I found out later after many mooons, that the `<input type="radio">` of months are confliction with `v-model` of veu.  
So when you click VEU js takes control and actually do his job, but fails in adding `checked` attribute to the seleced month radio input !.  

- Also in 'main' branch I have used a different method in styling and Implementing the accordion 

*How to see the changes*
- Visit Home page, and look at years and months accordion and try chooseing different year or a month, you will aslo notice that you have to double click the month in order to change its color.
